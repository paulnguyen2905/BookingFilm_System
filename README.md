# BookingFilm_System
This application is programming base on the platform of the CGV online booking system. I have this idea when I was a part-time staff working for CGV and learning Java programming languague.

# Built With
Eclipse IDE

Java Swing for the GUI

Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio as the cocal back-end database

# Install requirements
Remember to install 3 important jar files into the libr build path that I already put them in .settings and .settings/libr when you reinstall it on Eclipse IDE
```
jgoodies-forms-1.8.0.jar
miglayout15-swing.jar
mssql-jdbc-8.4.1.jre8.jar
```
You also have to put the origin database file I have created for this project into your SQL Server Management to have the database

# Running the project
If you use Microsoft SQL Server Mangement like me, remember to open and run the SQL Server Mangement first to connect to the SQL server so that the application can be fully run with the updated frequently database.
